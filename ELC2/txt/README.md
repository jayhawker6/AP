# README

## Before Running

This USED TO contain libraries/packages not installed by pip by default. If these are present, then to allow the import statement to work, do the following:

``` python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all dependencies which you do not have or inform you if your version of python is not compatible.

`If this does not work, make sure you are executing the python shell (not command prompt) in the file dir that requirements.txt is in.`

# IMPORTANT!
